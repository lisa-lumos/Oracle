# Oracle Admin tasks

## Schemas
Oracle define schemas as a `logical` container for data structures. Single schema name can be attached to many db objects. It helps avoid name collision. In oracle an user is synonymous to schema, if this user could perform ddl in this schema. The user that can only perform DML is not synonymous to schema.  

The test schema (HR), can be downloaded from Oracle.
